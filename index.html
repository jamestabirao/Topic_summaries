											<p class="fragment fade-up">An example of a financial security that pays investors interest-on-interest is the U.S. Savings bond, which is issued by a governmental body to raise funds from the public to fund its capital projects and other operations necessary to manage the economy.</p>

											<p class="fragment fade-up">These savings bonds are zero-coupon bonds that do not pay interest until they are redeemed or mature. The interest compounds semi-annually and accrues monthly every year for 30 years. Every six months, the monthly interest calculation is adjusted to include the accrued interest from the previous six months.</p>

											<p class="fragment fade-up">An investor who purchases the bond at the end of the month will still receive the interest accrued for the entire month since the Treasury only counts full months. Any interest paid at redemption or the maturity date is then issued electronically to the bondholder’s designated bank account.</p>

					- the skills, knowledge, and experience possessed by an individual or population, viewed in terms of their 
					value or cost to an organization or country.
					- An organization is often said to only be as good as its people. Directors, employees, and leaders who make 
					up an organization's human capital are critical to its success. -->
